<h3> Create multiple package to manage your application in MVC Architecutre</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>in.ineuron.controller:</b> controller is responsible for handling user input, processing requests, and coordinating interactions between the model and the view in an application.</li>
<li><b>in.ineuron.service:</b> "service layer" is a software architectural component or design pattern that provides a set of services or functionalities to an application.</li>
<li><b>in.ineuron.dao: </b>  "DAO" stands for "Data Access Object." It is a design pattern that is used to abstract and encapsulate the interaction with a data source or database.</li>
<li> <b>in.ineuron.dto: </b>"DTO" stands for "Data Transfer Object." A DTO is a design pattern used to transfer data between different layers or components of an application</li>
<li><b>in.ineuron.util: </b> collection of utility classes or functions that provide common, reusable functionality and tools that can be used across different parts of an application. </li>
<li><b>in.ineuron.factory: </b>provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is one of the most commonly used design patterns in object-oriented programming. The Factory Design Pattern promotes loose coupling by abstracting the process of object creation and centralizing it in a dedicated factory class or method. </li>
<li><b>in.ineuron.properties: </b>typically refers to a package or module that deals with configuration or property files </li>
